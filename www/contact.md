Most of the active discussion about SUMMA's development takes place on the [SUMMA github page](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/summa). We strongly suggest that you go look there first if you have questions regarding the code. In addition, the [Resources](resources.md) page on this web site and the `docs` directory in the SUMMA source code archive include information on the model background, installation and operation.

We do not have the resources to provide individual support for SUMMA. However, for more general questions, please send an email to [summa@rap.ucar.edu](mailto:summa@rap.ucar.edu).
