# Test Cases for SUMMA

We have developed a number of test cases that we use during model development to ensure that the model performs as expected after code changes. These test cases are also useful to ensure that your SUMMA installation is working correctly. The test cases consist of synthetic experiments with known solutions as well as test cases that were used in the original SUMMA papers (Clark et al., [2015a](../references.md#clark_2015a);[b](../references.md#clark_2015b);[c](../references.md#clark_2015c))

The full suite of SUMMA test cases can be obtained from the [NCAR SUMMA page](https://ral.ucar.edu/projects/summa) under the _Test Cases_ tab. Please make sure you have the correct version of the test cases for your version of the SUMMA code. After you unpack the archive, you can find information about how to install and run the test cases in `readme.md` in the top level directory.
