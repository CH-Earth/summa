1. Download the latest release of IDA solver from SUNDIALS package in https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software
2. Extract the corresponding compressed file
3. Since in SUMMA-SUNDIALS utilizes the Fortran/C interface FIDA, edit CMakeLists.txt before running cmake. That is, the following
setting needs to be enabled:
   # Fortran 2003 interface is disabled by default
   set(DOCSTR "Enable Fortran 2003 interfaces")
   option(F2003_INTERFACE_ENABLE "${DOCSTR}" ON)

4. Read INSTALL_GUIDE.pdf and follow the installation instructions

5. The default compiler is gfortan. To change it, add the following optoin to camke
   -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=your_favorite_compiler
   

6. In SUMMA Makefile, define the SUNDIALS libraries (-lsundials_fnvecmanyvector_mod -lsundials_fida_mod -lsundials_fnvecserial_mod
   -lsundials_fsunlinsoldense_mod -lsundials_fsunmatrixdense_mod) and path to include files.
