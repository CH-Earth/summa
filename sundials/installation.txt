1. Download the latest release of IDA solver from SUNDIALS package in https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software
% wget "https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/releases/download/v5.8.0/sundials-5.8.0.tar.gz"

2. Extract the corresponding compressed file
% tar -xzf sundials-5.8.0.tar.gz

3. Read INSTALL_GUIDE.pdf and follow the installation instructions. Roughly, do the following:
Make a directory outside the sundials-5.8.0 folder and enter it
% mkdir builddir
% cd /builddir

4. Since in SUMMA-SUNDIALS utilizes the Fortran/C interface FIDA, the following setting needs to be enabled while running the cmake inside the builddir:
% cmake ../sundials-5.8.0/ -DF2003_INTERFACE_ENABLE=ON -DBUILD_FORTRAN_MODULE_INTERFACE=ON 


5. The default compiler is gfortan. To change it (it should be the same as the netcdf build and the later summa build), you could also add the following option to cmake with your "my_gfortran"
   -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=my_gfortran

6. If the above went well, staying in the builddir directory run
% make

7. Enter summa directory and build summa as in /docs/SUMMA_instatllation.md. You will have to edit the SUMMA Makefile as below additionally (as well as install required libraries and link them as directed in the Makefile).

8. In SUMMA Makefile, define the FC_EXE to be the same compiler as you used for sundials and netcdf
   
9. In SUMMA Makefile, define the SUNDIALS libraries (-lsundials_fnvecmanyvector_mod -lsundials_fida_mod -lsundials_fnvecserial_mod
   -lsundials_fsunlinsoldense_mod -lsundials_fsunmatrixdense_mod)

10. In SUMMA Makefile, add the INCLUDES for these modules from the path you installed them at, for 	example 
	INCLUDES = -I/my_SundialsInstation/builddir/fortran_STATIC

11. Inside the /summa/build/ directory run
% make
