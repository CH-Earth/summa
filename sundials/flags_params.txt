To switch between SUMMA-BE and SUMMA-SUNDIALS, the "diffEqSolv" varialbe has been added to the var_lookup module. 
A user should add this variable to the model_decision file with one of the values "backwEuler" or "sundialIDA".
 For now, this value is by default "sundialIDA" in mDecisions.f90. 

In energy equation, the heat capacity is computed using either the analytical (closed) formula or the finite differece formula (dH_T/dT). The
"howHeatCap" varialbe has been added to the var_lookup module to handle such decision. A user should add this variable to the model_decision
file with one of the values "closedForm" or "enthalpyFD". For now, this value is by default "colsedForm" in mDecisions.f90. 

All SUMMA-SUNDIALS files are in build/source/engine. The important ones are as following:

systemSolvSundials.f90: contains public subroutine systemSolvSundials which runs the coupled energy-mass model for one timestep

solveByIDA.f90: contains public subroutine solveByIDA which solves the differential equation system F(y,y') = 0 by IDA (y is the state vector)
                and private subroutines setInitialCondition and setSolverParams. 
                setSolverParams can be used to to set paprmeters (maximum order, number of nonlinear iteration , etc) in IDA solver

evalDAE4IDA.f90: contains public function evalDAE4IDA which is the interface wrapper for computing the residual vector F(t,y,y') required for IDA solver

eval8DAE.f90: contains public subroutine eval8DAE which computes the residual vector mainly by calling varExtractSundials, updateVarsSundials, computFlux,
              and computResidDAE. We also switch between different forms of the energy equation in this subroutine. 

evalJac4IDA.f90: contains public function evalJac4IDA which is the interface wrapper for computing the Jacobian matrix dF/dy + c dF/dy' for IDA solver

eval8JacDAE.f90: contains public subroutine eval8JacDAE which computes the residual vector and the Jacobian matrix mainly by calling computJacDAE
