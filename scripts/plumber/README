This directory holds routines to prepare plumber experiments for SUMMA

+++
PREPARE INPUT FILES...
**********************

1) processPlumberInputData.pro
   IDL script to read the site netCDF files and output
    a) input data files for each site
    b) attribute files for each site

2) makeForcingFileInfo.sh
   script to define forcing data files, creating
    a) list of forcing info files used for each site
    b) information on the forcing data file for each site

3) makeFileManager.sh
   script to make the manager files; separate file for each site

4) makeDecisionsFiles.sh
   script to make the model decisions files
   A separate decisions file is needed for each site, because the time
   period of the simulation is a decision (which differs for each site)

5) modifySiteVars.sh
   script to read some of the needed site variables from one of the
   participating PLUMBER models (CABLE in this case) and include the
   site variables in a paramTrial file, separate trial file for each
   site

+++
RUN THE MODEL...
****************

6) runPlumberSites.sh
   script to run SUMMA for all PLUMBER sites

+++
POST-PROCESS...
***************

7) summa2plumber.sh
   script to convert the SUMMA output to the PLUMBER format
   uses two nco scripts
    a) extractGroundHeatFlux1.nco
    b) extractGroundHeatFlux2.nco
   which use different methods to extract the heat flux at the top of the soil column
   and convert to a scale groundHeatFlux variable.

+++
EVALUATION...
***************

8) read_groundHeatFlux.pro
   IDL script to check that we read the ground heat flux correctly

9) plot_plumber.pro
   IDL script to plot up the PLUMBER results
